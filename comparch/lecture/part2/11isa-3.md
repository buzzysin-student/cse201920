## What is ARM?

- The worlds most populous processor
- Based in Cambridge

## ARM Thumb V1

### Features of ARM Thumb V1

- Powerful and compact
- Contemporary
- Good performance for code size
- It is a 16-bit ISA
  - _This is the length of the instructions_
- We will only study a few instructions, for educational purposes

## Features of the ARM architecture

- The ARM architecture is a [**register machine**](#register-features)
- The architecture uses RISC instruction set
- Good support for mulitple memory addressing modes
- Effective with stacks

### Register features

The registers are very flexible because they are independant from each other, i.e. any of them can be used in an instruction to compute.

This gives the features:

- Register assignment (i.e. finding free registers to store data)
- Variable manipulation (i.e. "remembering" a register/memory location that stores data)
- Includes a program counter
  - Branches can be made the result of an arithmetic expression

### Memory manipulation

The addressing modes available to this ISA are:

- immediate
- direct
- register-indirect
- indexed

#### Example

To write `42` to memory:

```c
1. MOV r0, #8   // Place 8 in r0
2. MOV r1, #42  // Place 42 in r1
3. STR r1, [r0] // Write r1 to r0
```

### The Program Counter

The program counter follows a three-stage pipeline model:

| Instruction | Fetch/Decode | Execute | Write |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------- | ----- |
| 1           | ...          | ...     | ...   |
| 2           | 1            | ...     | ...   |
| 3           | 2            | 1       | ...   |
| 4           | 3            | 2       | 1     |

The `fetch/decode` part of the pipeline is always 2 instructions behind the `write` part, so the program counter is always ahead of the current instruction by 2 instructions.

### Summary

- Thumb is a 16-bit instruction set
- This has some limitiations
  - Encoding three registers takes 12 bits (4 bits left over)
  - Fewer opcodes
  - Opcode length is variable between 5-10 bits.

|                                  r5                                   |
|                                  r6                                   |

|                                  r8                                   |
|                                  r9                                   |
|                                  r10                                  |

|                                  r12                                  |

|                                  r14                                  |
|                                  r15                                  |

## Register encoding

- Three explicit: `ADD r0, r1, r2` - compute `add` and store in `r0`
- Two explicit, one implicit: `AND r0, r1` - compute `and` and store in `r0`

## High instructions

- These instructions use registers greater than register 7 (the general registers)
- They sacrifice the use of three-register instructions and only use two
  - Example: `ADDH r0, r1`

## Conditionality

Certain instructions have a **side-effect**. This includes setting control bits in the flag register.

Some instructions become dependant on these registers.

Example status registers:

| Bit number | Symbol | Condition Test |
| :--------: | :----: | :------------: |
|     31     |   N    |    Negative    |
|     30     |   Z    |      Zero      |
|     29     |   C    |     Carry      |
|     28     |   V    |    Overflow    |
