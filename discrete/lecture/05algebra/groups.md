## What is a group

A group consists of a set and a binary operation:

![fn](<https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline \left\langle G, \bullet \right\rangle>) for example, where _G_ could be the set {1,-1}, and the operator (denoted by the bullet) _times_.

## Axioms of a group

![](<https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline \text{Consider a set }G \text{ and an operation, }\bullet\text{, forming the group} \left\langle G,\bullet \right\rangle>)

### Closed operation (closure)

![fn](<https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline \text{If } x,y \in G \text{ then } x \bullet y \in G >)

This is the property that operations on a set will always return elements in the set.

### Associative

![fn](<https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline (x \bullet y) \bullet z = x \bullet (y \bullet z)>)

This is the property that "bracketing" doesn't change the result of the computation.

### Identity

This is the property that there exists an element in the set that has no effect when computed with another element.

![fn](<https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex? \exists x\in G : >)

### Inverse
