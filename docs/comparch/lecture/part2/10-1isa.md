## What is an ISA

An ISA is a contract between hardware and software - attributes of a system as seen by a programmer.

An ISA defines the interface between hardware and software - an predetermined set of instructions that are used to communicate between the software and hardware stacks

An ISA specifies the behaviour of instructions sent to the processor

## What comprises an ISA

An ISA contains:

- Opcodes
- Data types
- Registers
- Memory addressing modes
- Memory architecture
- Interrupt/Exception handling
- I/O operations

## The 'I' in ISA

This stands for 'instruction'. It defines the unique operation code and information regarding the operation

An instruction has 0+ arguments (i.e. none or many).

### Example

> Note - Instructions should map to unique meanings, i.e. no two opcodes should have the same meaning, to keep the definitions unique

# Designing an ISA

## The bad

Do **not** code every instruction possible! (i.e. keep instruction set as basic as possible)

This leads to the following problem:

- Expandability - limited future support
- Energy consumption - more transistors
- Cost - increased hardware for little benefit
- Unused instructions - wasted hardware/instruction storage

## The good

Design an ISA that meets basic needs, then expand as necessary. Only the minimum number of instructions are necessary for an ISA.

## Types of instructions

There are three main classes of instructions for **simple processors**:

- Arithmetic - `add, mul, sub, etc.`
- Comparison - `cmp, etc.`
- Memory - `load, store, etc.`
- Control flow - `b, bifeq, bifneq, etc.`

More complex ISAs would contain support for _vector/digital signal processing_.

## The nature of instructions

Consider:

- Common operations
- Representative applications
- Future-proofing
