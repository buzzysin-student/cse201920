## Recap

### Group Definition

A groups is a set _G_ and a binary operator (**.**) which together satisfy the following conditions

1. Closure

   $\forall x,y \in G, x\bullet y \in G$

   In words: any operation on elements in the set should give only elements in the set.

2. Associativity

   $\forall x,y \in G, (x\bullet y)\bullet z = x\bullet (y\bullet z)$

   In words: The grouping of operations should not matter.

3. Identity

   $\exists e\in G, \forall x \in G, e \bullet x = x \bullet e = x$

   In words: There is an identity element for the operation.

4. Inverse

   $\forall x \in G, \exists x^{-1}\in G : x \bullet x^{-1} = e$

   In words: every element has an inverse.

## Definition

Abelian Groups follow another axiom

- Commutativity

  $\forall x,y \in G, x\bullet y = y\bullet x$

  In words: order of operations don't matter.
