## Definiton of Inference rules

An inference rule is a structure of logic that is used to construct a proof. There are a few different types of inference rules:

### Modus Ponens

$$
{\text{Statement} \above .5pt \text{Result} } \\
\\ \space \\
\text{ reads } \\
\\ \space \\
\text{if Statement, then Result } \\
\text{ and is also written as $A \implies B$}
$$

### Syllogism

$$
{\text{All X is Y, Z is an X} \above .5pt \text{Z is a Y}}
$$
