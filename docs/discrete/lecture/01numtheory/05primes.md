## Definition

A prime number is a number that has only two divisors - itself and one.

$$
p \text{ is prime if } n\not|~p, \forall n \in (\Z^+ - \left \{ 1,p\right\})
$$

In words: $p$ is prime if for any integer $n$, $n$ does not divide $p$ so long as $n$ is not $1$ or $p$.

A non-exhaustive list of examples:

$$
\mathbb P = \left\{ 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,...\right\}
$$

The set of primes is infinite, as proved in [the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic][fta].
