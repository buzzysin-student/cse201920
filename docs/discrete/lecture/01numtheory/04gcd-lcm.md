## Greatest common divisor definition

Consider the numbers $a$ and $b$. If there is a number such that $c$ divides a and b, and $c$ is divisible by all factors of $a$ and $b$, then $c$ is the Greatest Commmon Factor of $a$ and $b$.

$$
\text {Let common factors := \(\mathbb F_c \) = \{ $f$: \(f|a\) and \(f|b\) \}, then }\\
gcd(a,b) = c \in \mathbb F_c \text{ where \(c|k, \forall k \in \mathbb F_c \) }
$$
