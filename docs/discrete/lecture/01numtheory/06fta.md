## The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

The Fundametal Theorem of Arithmetic is quite a scary name, but all it really means is that every number _greater than one_ (since 1 is not prime) can be expressed as a product of primes.

### Examples

$$
% Definitions
\def\x#1{\times #1}
% End Definitions
\begin{aligned}
40 &= 2^3\x5 \\
94 &= 2\x47 \\
53 &= 53 ~(\text{53 is prime})
\end{aligned}
$$

## Proof of no largest prime

Assume that there is a largest prime = $p_n$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Consider } P = p_1p_2p_3...p_n+1 \\
&\implies \frac{P}{p_k} \text{ has remainder }1, \forall k\in\{1,2,...,n\} \\
&\mnplies \
\end{aligned}
$$
