## 3D interpretation of linear systems

### Solution constraints

What determines whether a system of equations has a solution?

### Zero determinant

If a system of equations has zero determinant, this could be due to two reasons.

#### Inconsistency (no solution)

This implies that the planes defined by the system of equations do not intersect at a single, unique point.

#### Degeneracy (infinite solutions)

This implies that the planes defined by the system of equations intersect in a line, for example, there exists a line that is parallel to all three planes and intersects with all three planes.
