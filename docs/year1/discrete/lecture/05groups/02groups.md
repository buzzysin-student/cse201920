## What is a group

A group consists of a set and a binary operation:

$ \left\langle G, \bullet \right\rangle$ for example, where _G_ could be the set {1,-1}, and the operator (denoted by the bullet) _times_.

## Axioms of a group

$ \text{Consider a set }G \text{ and an operation, }\bullet\text{, forming the group} \langle G,\bullet \rangle$

### Closed operation (closure)

$ \text{If } x,y \in G \text{ then } x \bullet y \in G $

This is the property that operations on a set will always return elements in the set.

### Associative

$ (x \bullet y) \bullet z = x \bullet (y \bullet z)$

This is the property that "bracketing" doesn't change the result of the computation.

### Identity

This is the property that there exists an element in the set that has no effect when computed with another element.

$ \exists x\in G : $

### Inverse
