## Ideal sources

The types of sources covered are:

- Independant sources
  - Voltage sources - voltage is kept constant across terminals
  - Current sources - current is kept constant across terminals
- Dependant sources
  - Voltage-controlled voltage/current source - voltage/current is **dependant** on another voltage in the circuit
  - Current-controlled voltage/current source - voltage/current is **dependant** on another current in the circuit

## Kirchhoff's Laws

KCL - this law states that the sum of all currents coming in and out of a node is zero.

KVL - this law states that the sum of voltages in any closed loop is zero.
