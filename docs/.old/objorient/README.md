## Shared code

It's Taharka here. Just letting you know that (if you use the bash terminal) you can install my general-purpose compiler! Just type in the following to your terminal:

```bash
# Download the file
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buzzysin/cse201920/master/compile
# Install the file
bash ./compile -I
# Remove the installer
rm ./compile
# Try it out!
compile
```

Easy as pie :smile:

> Note: you may have to restart your terminal to get this to work
