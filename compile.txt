=========
  
---------
C Options
---------
-c <path> *
  Compile the C source script located at <path> (*required)
  using 'clang'

  Example: 
  ./compile -c ./c/program.c # Outputs a file './c/program'

-m
  Note: If used, it must be used with -c.
  Note: If used, the Makefile command must have the same name
        as the source file.

  Tells this program to use the Makefile located in the same
  directory as <path> instead of 'clang'

  Example:
  ./compile -mc ./c/program.c # Or ./compile -m -c ./c/program.c
                              # Uses Makefile commands instead
                              # of 'clang'

---------------
Haskell Options
---------------
-h <path> *
  Compile the Haskell source script located at <path> (*required)
  using 'ghc'

  Example: 
  $ ./compile ./haskell/program.hs # Outputs a file './haskell/program'
                                   # and others.
