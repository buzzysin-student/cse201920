## Definition

## Methods

### Integration by Substitution

### Integration by Parts

#### Recursive Integration

### Integration with Partial fractions

#### Creating partial fractions

#### Dealing with complex-root denominators

#### Dealing with improper fractions

## Considerations

### Improper integrals

This occures when the **endpoints for an integrand aren't well defined**, or when **the integrand is infinite at an endpoint**
 
The solution? **Use limits**.
